# Log_Me_In

## Intro
This script uses the selenium module to automate the login process of two popular cryptocurrency exchanges. The chromedriver is most commonly used with this package, however I prefer to used the Brace Browser. Given that Brave is based on Chrome, you simply have to modify the executable path for the chromedriver to wherever you have Brave stored on your machine. 
### Security 
Obviously this script does not contain any passwords or usernames due to the blatent security issues that would cause. To run this script, use a json format for your credentials and save them in an encrypted diskimage with a strong password. When run you will be prompted for your password to unlock the diskimage and the rest is automated. Any two factor authentication there after must be completed manually.
